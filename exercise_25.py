# Exercise 25:Units of Time(Again).

"""
In this exercise you will reverse the process described in the previous
exercise. Develop a program that begins by reading a number of seconds from
the user. Then your program should display the equivalent amount oftime in the
form D:HH:MM:SS, where D,HH, MM, SS represent days, hours, minutes and seconds
respectively. The hours, minutes, and seconds should all be formatted so that
they occupy exactly two digits, with a leading 0 displayed if neccesary.
