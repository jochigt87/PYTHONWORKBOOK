# Exercise 99:Arbitrary Base Conversions.

"""
Write a program that allows the user to convert a number form one base to
another. Your program should support bases between 2 and 16 for both the input
number and the result number. If the user chooses a base outside of this range
then an appropiate error message should be displayed and the program should
exit. Divide your program into several functions, including a function that
converts from an arbitrary base to base 10, function that converts from base
10 to an arbitrary base, and a main program that reads the bases and input
number from the user. You may find  your solutions to Exercises 77, 78 and 98
helpful when completing this exercise.
