# Exercise 49: Ritcher Scale.

"""
The following table contains earthquake magnitude ranges on the Ritcher scale
and their descriptors:

    Magnitude               |Descriptor
    Less than 2.0           |Micro
    2.0 to less than 3.0    |Very minor
    3.0 to less than 4.0    |Minor
    4.0 to less than 5.0    |Light
    5.0 to less than 6.0    |Moderate
    6.0 to less than 6.0    |Strong
    7.0 to less than 8.0    |Major
    8.0 to less than 10.0   |Great
    10.0 or more            |Meteoric

Write a program that reads a magnitude from the user and displays the
appropiate descriptor as part of a meaningful message. For example, if the
user enters 5.5 then your program should indicate that a magnitude 5.5
earthquake is considered to be a moderate earthquake.
