# Exercise 21:Area of a Triangle.

"""
The area of a triangle can be computed using the following formula, whre b its
the lenght of the base of the triangle, and h is its height:

area = b*h/2

Write a program that allows the user to enter values for b and h. The program
should then compute and display the area of a triangle with base lenght b and
height h.
