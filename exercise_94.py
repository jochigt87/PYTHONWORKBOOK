# Exercise 94:Random Password.

"""
Write a function that generates a random password. The password should have a
random lenght of between 7 and 10 characters. Each character should be
randomly selected from positions 33 to 126 in the ASCII table. Your function
will not take any parameters. It will return the randomly generated password
as its only result. Display the randomly generated passwod in your file's main
program. Your main program should only run when your solution has not been
imported into another file.

Hint: You will probably find the chr function helpful when completing this
exercise. Detailed information about this function is available online.
