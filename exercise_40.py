# Exercise 40:Name that Triangle.

"""
A triangle can be classified base on the lenghts of its sides as equilateral,
isosceles or scalene. All 3 sides of an equilateral triangle have the same
lenght, and a third side that is a different lenght. If all of the sides have
different lenghts then the triangle is scalene.
Write a program that reads the lenghts of 3 sides of a triangle from the user.
Display a message indicating the type of the triangle.
