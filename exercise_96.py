# Exercise 96:Check a Password.

"""
In this exercise you will write a function that determines whether or not a
password is good. We will define a good password to be a one that is at least 8
characters long and contains at least one uppercase letter, at least on
lowercase letter, and at least one number. Your function should return true if
the password passed to it as its only parameter is good. Otherwise it should
return false. Include a main program that reads a password from the user and
reports whether or not it is good. Ensure that your main program only runs
when your solution has not been imported into another file.
