# Exercise 131:Morse Code.

"""
Morse code is an encoding scheme that uses dashes and dots to represent
numbers and letters. in this exercise, you will write a program that uses a
dictionary to store the mapping from letters and numbers to Morse code. Use a
period to represent a dot, and a hyphen to represent a dash. The mapping from
letters and numbers to dashes and dots is shown in Table 6.1.

Your program should read a message from the user. Then it should translate
each letter and number in the message to Morse code, leaving a space between
each sequence of dashes and dots. Your program should Ignore any characters
that are not letters or numbers. The Morse code for Hello, World! is shown
below:
            .... . .-.. .-. . --- .-- --- .-. .-.. -..

Morse code was originally developed in the nineteenth century for use over
telegraph wires. It is still used today, over 160 years after it was first
created.
