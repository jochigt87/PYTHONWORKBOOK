# Exercise 167:Recursive Palindrome.

"""
The notion of palindrome was introduced previously in Exercise 72. In this
exercise you will write a recursive function that determines whether or not a
string is a palindrome. The empty string is a palindrome, as is any string
containing only one character. Any longer string is a palindrome if its first
and last characters match, and if the string formed by removing the first and
last characters is also a palindrome.

Write a main program that reads a string from the user. Use your recursive
function to determine whether or not the string is a palindrome. Then display
an appropiate message for the user.
