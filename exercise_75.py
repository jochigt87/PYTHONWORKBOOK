# Exercise 75: Greatest Common Divisor.

"""
The greastest common divisor of two positive integers, n and m, is the largest
number, d which divides evenly into both n and m. There are several algorithms
that can be used to solve this problem, including:

    Initialize d to the smallest of m and n.
    While d does not evenly divide m or d does not evenly divide n do:
        Decrease the value of d by 1
    Report d as the greastest common divisor of n and m.

Write a program that reads two positive integers from the user and uses this
algorithm to determine and report their greatest common divisor.
