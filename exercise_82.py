# Exercise 81:Taxi Fare.

"""
In a particular jurisdiction, taxis fares consist of a base fare of $4.00,
plus $0.25 for every 140 meters traveled. Write a function that takes the
distance traveled (in kilometers) as its only parameter and returns the total
fare as its only result. Write a main program that demonstrates the function.

Hint: Taxi fares change over time. Use constants to represent the base fare
and the variable portion of the fare so that the program can be updated easily
when the rates increase.
