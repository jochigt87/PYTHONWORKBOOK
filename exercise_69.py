# Exercise 69:Approximate pi.

"""
The value of pi can be approximated by the following infinite series:

    pi = 3+4/2*3*4 - 4/4*5*6 + 4/6*7*8 - 4/8*9*10 + 4/10*11*12

Write a program that displays 15 approximations of pi. The first
approximation should make use of only the first term from the infinite series.
Each additional approximation displayed by your program should include one
more term in the series, making it a better approximation of pi than any of
the approximations displayed previously.
