"""
The baby names data set consists of over 200 files. Each file contains a list
of 100 names, along with the number of times each name was used. There are two
files for each year: one containing names used for girls and other containing
names used for boys. the data set includes data for every year from 1900 to
2012.
    Write a program that reads every file in the data set and identifies all
the names that were most popular in at least one year. Your program should
output two lists:

    *one containing the most popular names for boys.
    *other containing the most popular names for girls.
Neither of your lists should include any repeated values.
