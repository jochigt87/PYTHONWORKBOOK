# Exercise 102:Reduce Measures.

"""
Many recipe books still use cups, tablespoons and teaspoons to describe the
volumes of ingredients used when cooking or baking. While such recipes are
easy enough to follow if you have the appropiate measuring cups and spoons,
they can be difficult to double, triple or quadruple when cooking Christmas
dinner for the entire extended family. For example, a recipe that calls for 4
tablespoons of an ingredient requires 16 tablespoons when quadrupled. However,
16 tablespoons would be better expressed (and easier to measure) as 1 cup.

    Write a function that express that imperial volume using the largest
units posible. The function will take the number of units as its first
parameter, and the unit of measure(cup, tablespoon or teaspoon) as its
second parameter. Return a string representing the measure using the largest
possible units as the function's only result.

For example, if the function is provided with parameters representing 59
teaspoons then it should return the string "1 cup, 3 tablespoon, 2 teaspoon".

Hint: One cup is equivalent to 16 tablespoons. One tablespoon is equivalent to
3 teaspoons.
