# Exercise 163: Words with Six Vowel in Order.

"""
There is at least one word in the English language that contains each of the
vowels a, e, i, o, u and y exactly once and in order. Write a program that
searches a file containing a list of words and displays all of the words that
meet this constraint. The user will provide the name of the file that will be
searched. Display an appropiate error message and exit the program if the user
provides an invalid file name or if something else goes wrong while searching
for words with six vowels in order.:
