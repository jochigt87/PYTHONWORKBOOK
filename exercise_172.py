# Exercise 172:Element Sequences.

"""
Another game that some people play with the names of chemical elements
involves constructing sequence of elements where each element in the sequence
begins with the last letter of its predecessor. For example, if a sequence
begins with Hydrogen, then the next element must be an element that begins
with N, such as Nickel. The element sequence that is constructed can not
contain any duplicates.
    Write a program that reads the name of an element from the user. Your
program should use a recursive function to find the longest sequence of
elements that begins with the entered element. Then it should display the
sequence. Ensure that your program responds in a reasonable way if the user
does not enter a valid element name.

Hint: It may take your program up to two minites to find the longest sequence
for some elements. As a result, you might want to use element like Molybdenum
and Magnesium as your first test cases. Each has a longest sequence that is
only 8 elements long which your program should find in a fraction of a second.
