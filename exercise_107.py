"""
In this exercise, you will create a program that reads words from the user
until the user enters a blank line. After the user enters a blank line your
program should display each word entered by the user exactly once. The words
should be displayed in the same order that they were ented. For example, if
the user enters:

    first
    second
    first
    third
    second

    then your program should display:

    first
    second
    third
