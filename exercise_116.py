# Exercise 116:Pig Latin Improved.

"""
Extend your solution to Exercise 115 so that is correctly handles uppercase
letters and punctuation marks such as commas, periods, question marks and
exclamation marks. If an English word begins with uppercase letter then its
Pig Latin representation should also begin with an uppercase letter and the
uppercase letter moved to the end of the word should be charged to lowercase.
For example, Computer should become Omputercay. If a word ends in a
punctuation mark then the punctuation mark should remain at the end of the
word after the transformation has been perfomed. For example, Science! should
become Iencescay!.
