# Loop Exercises.

# Exercise 61:Average.

"""
in this exercise you will create a program that computes the average of
collection of values entered by the user. The user will enter 0 as a sentinel
value to indicate that no further values will be provided. Your program should
display an appropiate error message if the first value entered by the user is
0.

Hint: Because the 0 marks the end of the input it should not be included in
the average.
