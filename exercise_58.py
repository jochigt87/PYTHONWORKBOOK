# Exercise 58:Next Day.

"""
Write a program that reads a date from the user and computes immediate
successor. For example, if the user enters values that represent 2013-11-18
then your program should display a message indicating that the day immediately
after 2013-11-18 is 2013-11-19. If the user enters values that represent
2013-11-30 then the program should indicate that the next day is 2013-12-01.
If the user enters values that represent 2013-12-31 then the program should
indicate that the next day is 2014-01-01. The date will be entered in numeric
form with three separate input statements; one for the year, one for the
month, and one for the day. Ensure that your program works correctly for leap
years.
