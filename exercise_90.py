# Exercise 90:Does a String Represent an integer?.

"""
In this exercise you will write a function named isInteger that determines
whether or not the characters in a string represent a valid integer. When
determining if a string represents an integer you should ignore any leading or
trailling white space. Once this white space is ignored, a string represents
an integer if its length is at least 1 and it only contains digits, or if its
first character is either + or - and the first character is followed by one or
more characters, all of which are digits.
    Write a main program that reads a string from the user and reports whether
or not it represents an integer. Ensure that the main program will not run if
the file containing your solution is imported into another program.

Hint: You may find the lstrip, rstrip and/or strip methods for strings helpful
when completing this exercise. Documentation for these methods is available
online.
