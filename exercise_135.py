# Exercise 135:Anagrams.

"""
Two words are anagrams if they contain all of the same letters, but in a
different order. For example, "evil" and "live" are anagrams because each
contains one e, one i, one l, and one v. Create a program that reads two
string from the user, determines whether or not they are anagrams, and reports
the result.
