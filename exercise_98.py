# Exercise 98:Hexadecimal and Decimal Digits.

"""
Write two functions, hex2int and int2hex, that convert between hexadecimal
digits (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E and F) and base 10 integers. The hex2int
function is responsible for converting string containing a single hexadecimal
digit to a base 10 integer, while the int2hex function is reponsible for
converting an integer between 0 and 15 to a single hexadecimal digit. Each
function will take the value to convert as its only parameter and return the
converted value as function's only result. Ensure that the hex2int function
works correctly for both uppercase and lowercase letters. Your functions
should end the program with a meaningful error message if an invalid parameter
is provided.
