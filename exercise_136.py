# Exercise 136:Anagrams Again.

"""
The notion of anagrams can be extended to multiple words. For example,
"Willian Shakespeare" and "I am a weakish speller" are anagrams when
capitalization and spacing are Ignored.

Extend your program from Exercise 135 so that it is able to check if two
phrases are anagrams. Your program should ignore capitalization, puntuation
marks and spacing when marking the determination.
