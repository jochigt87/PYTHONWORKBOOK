# Exercise 85:Convert an Integer to its Ordinal Number.

"""
Words like first, second and third are referred to as ordinal numbers. In this
exercise, you will write a function that takes an integer as its only
parameter and return a string containing the appropiate English ordinal number
as its only result. Your function must handle the integers between 1 and 12
(inclusive). It should return an empty string if a value outside of this range
is provided as a parameter. Include a main program that demonstrates your
function by displaying each integer from 1 to 12 and its ordinal number. Your
main program should only run when your file has not been importted into
another program.
