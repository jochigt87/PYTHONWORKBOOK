# Exercise 133: Write Out Numbers in English.

"""
While the popularity of cheques as payment method has diminished in recent
years, some companies still issue them to pay employees or vendors. The amount
being paid normally appears on a cheque twice, with one occurrence written
using digits, and the other occurrence written using English words. Repeating
the amount in two different forms makes it much more difficult for an
unscrupulous employee or vendor to modify the amount on the cheque before
depositing it.
In this exercise, you task is to create a function that takes an integer
between 0 and 999 as its only parameter, and returns a string containing the
English words for that number. For example, if the parameter to the function
is 142 then your function should return "one hundred forty two". Use one or
more dictionaries to implement your solution rather than large if/elif/else
construcs. Include a main program that reads an integer from the user and
displays it value in English words.
