# Exercise 126:Generate All Sublists of a List.

"""
Using the definition of a sublist from Exercise 125, write a function that
returns a list containing every possible sublist of a list. For example, the
sublists of [1, 2, 3] are [], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [2, 3] and  [1, 2, 3].
Note that your function will always return a list containing at least the
empty list because the empty list is a sublist of every list. Include a main
program that demonstrates your function by displaying all of the sublists of
several different lists.
