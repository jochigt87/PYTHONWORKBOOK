# Exercise 138:Create a Bingo Card.

"""
A Bingo card consists of 5 columns of 5 numbers. The columns are labeled with
the letters B, I, N, G and O. There are 15 numbers that can appear under each
letter. In particular, the numbers that can appear under the B range from 1 to
15, the numbers can appear under the I range from 16 to 30, the numbers that
can appear under the N range from 31 to 45, and so on.
    Write a function that creates a random Bingo card and stores it in a
dictionary. The keys will be letters B, I, N, G and O. The values will be the
lists of five numbers that appear under each letter. Write a second function
that displays the Bingo card with the columns labeled appropriately. use these
functions to write a program that displays a random Bingo card. Ensure that
the main program only runs when the file containing your solution has not been
imported into another program.

You may be aware that Bingo cards often have a "free" space in the middle of
the card. We won't consider the free space in this exercise.
