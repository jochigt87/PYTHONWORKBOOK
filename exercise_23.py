# Exercise 23: Area of a Regular Polygon.

"""
A Polygon is regular if its sides area all the same lenght and the angles
between all the adjacent sides are equal. The area of a regular polygon can be
computed using the following formula, where s is the lenght of a side and n is
the number of sides:

        area = n*s^2 / 4 * tan(pi/n)

Write a program that reads s and n fromthe user and then display the area of a
regular polygon constructed from these values.
