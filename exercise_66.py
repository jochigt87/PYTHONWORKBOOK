# Exercise 66:Compute a Grade Point Average.

"""
Exercise 51 included a table that shows the conversion from letter grades to
grade points at particular academic institution. In this exercise you will
compute the grade point average of an arbitrary number of letter grades
entered by the user. The user will enter  blank line to indicate that all of
the grades have provided. For example, if the user enters A, followed by C+,
followed by a blank line then your program should report a grade point average
of 3.1.
You many find your solution to Exercise 51 helpful when completing this
exercise. Your program does not need to do any error checking. It can assume
that each value entered by the user will always be a valid letter grade or a
blank line.
