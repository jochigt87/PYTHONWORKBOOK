# Exercise 129: Two Dice Simulation.

"""
In this exercise you will simulate 1000 rolls of two dice. Begin by writing a
function that simulates rolling a pair of six-sided dice. Your function will
not take any parameters. It will return the total that was rolled on two dice
as its only result.
Write a main program that uses your function to simulate rolling two six-sided
dice. Your function will not take any parameters. It will return the total
that was rolled on two dice as its only result.

Write main program that uses your function to simulate rolling two six-sided
dice 1,000 times. As your program runs, it should count the number of times
that each total occurs. Then it should display a table that summarizes this
data. Express the frequency for each total as a percentage of the total number
of rolls. Your program should also display the percentage expected by
probability theory for each total. Sample output is shown below.

    Total       Simulated Percent       Expected Percent
        2                   2.90                    2.78
        3                   6.90                    5.56
        4                   9.40                    8.33
        5                   11.90                   11.11
        6                   14.20                   13.89
        7                   14.20                   16.67
