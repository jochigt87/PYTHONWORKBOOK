# Exercise 165:Greatest Common Divisor.

"""
Euclid wwas Greek mathematician who lived approximately 2,300 years ago. His
algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two positive integers,
a and b, is both efficient and recursive. It is outlined below:

    If b is 0 then
        Return a
    Else
        Set c equal to the remainder when a is divided by b
        Return the greatest common divisor of b and c

    Write a program that implements Euclid's algorithm and uses it to
determine the greatest common divisor of two integers entered by the user.
