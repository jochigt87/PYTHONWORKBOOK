"""
In this exercise you will create a Python program that identifies the longest
word(s) in a file. Your program should output an appropriate message that
includes the length of the longest word, along with all of the words of that
length that occurred in the file. Treat any group of non-white space
characters as a word, even if it includes numbers or punctuation marks.
