# Exercise 54:Wavelenghts of Visible Light.

"""
The wavelenghts of visible light ranges from 380 to 750 (nm). While the
spectrum is continuous, it is often divided into 6 colors as shown below:

    --------------------------
    Color   |Wavelenghts (nm)|
    Violet  |380 to less than 450
    Blue    |450 to less than 495
    Green   |495 to less than 570
    Yellow  |570 to less than 590
    Orange  |590 to less than 620
    Red     |620 to 720

Write a program that reads a wavelenghts from the user and reports its color.
Display an appropriate error message if the wavelenght entered by the user is
utside of the visible spectrum.
