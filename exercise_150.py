# File and Exceptions Exercises.

# Exercise 150:Remove Comments.

"""
Python uses the # character to mark the beggining of a comments. The comment
end s at the end of the line containing the # character. In this exercise, you
will create a program that removes all of the comments from Python source
file. Check each line in the file to determine if a # character is present. If
it is then your program should remove all of the characters from the #
character to the end of the line (we'll ignore the situation where the
comment character occurs inside of a string). Save the modified file using a
new name that will be entered by the user. The user will also enter the name
of the input file. Ensure that an appropiate error message is displayed if a
problem is encountered while accessing the files.
