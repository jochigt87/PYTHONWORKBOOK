"""
The amount of energy required to increase the temperature of one gram of a
material by one degree Celsius is the material's specific heat capacity, C.
The total amount of energy required to raise m grams of a material by 𝚫T
degrees Celsius can be computed using the formula:

                    q = m.C.𝚫T.
