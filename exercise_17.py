# Exercise 17: Heat Capacity.

"""
The amount of energy required to increase the temperature of one gram of a
material by one degree Celsius is the material's specific heat capacity, C.
The total amount of energy required to raise m grams of a material by 𝚫T
degrees Celsius can be computed using the formula:

                    q = m.C.𝚫T.

    Write a program that reads the mass of some water and the temperature
    change from the user. Your program should display the total amount of
    energy that must be added or removed to archieve the desired temperature
    change.

Hint: The specific heat capacity of water is 4.186 j/g℃ . Because water has a
desinsity of 1.0 gram per millitre, you can use grams and millitres
interchangeably in this exercise.

Extend your program so that it also computes the cost of heating the water.
Electricity is normally billed using units of kilowatt hours rather than
Joules. In this exercise, you should assume that electricity costs 8.9 cents
per kilowatt-hour. Use your program to compute the cost of boiling water for a
cup of coffee.

Hint: You will need to look up the factor for converting between Joules and
kilowatt hours to complete the last part of this exercise.
