# Exercise 91:Operador Precedence:.

"""
Write a function named precedence that returns an integer representing the
precedence of a mathematical operator. A string containing the operator will
be passed to the function as its only parameter. Your function should return 1
for + and -, 2 for * and /, and 3 for ^. If the string passed to the function
is not one of these operators then the function should return -1. Include a
main program that reads an operator from the user and either displays the
operator's precedence or an error message indicating that the input was not an
operator. Your main program should only run when the file containing your
solution has not been imported into another program.

Hint: In this exercise, along with others that appear later in the book, we
will use ^ to represent exponentiation. Using ^ instead of Python's choice of
** will make these exercises easier because an operator will always be a
single character.
