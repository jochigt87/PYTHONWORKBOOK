# Exercise 22:Area of a Triangle(Again).

"""
In the previous exercise you created a program that computed the area of a
triangle when the lenght of its base and its height were known. It is also
possible to compute the area of a triangle when the lenghts of all three sides
are known. Let s1, s2 and s3 be the lenghts of the sides. Let s = (s1 + s2 +
s3)/2. then the area of the triangle can be calculated using the following
formula:

    area = sqrt(s * (s - s1) * (s - s2) * (s - s3))

Develop a program that reads the lenghts of the sides of a triangle from the
user and display its area.
