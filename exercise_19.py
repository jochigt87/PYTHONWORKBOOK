"""
Create a program that determines how quickly an object is traveling when it
hits the ground. The user will enter the height from which the object is
dropped in meters(m). Because the object is dropped its initial speed is 0
m/s. Assume that the accelaration due to gravity is 9.8m/s^2. You can use the
formula vf = sqrt(v^2 + 2ad to compute the final speed, vf, when the initial
speed, vi, accelaration, a, and distance, d, are known.
