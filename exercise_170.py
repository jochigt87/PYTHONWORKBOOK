"""
Create a program that determines whether or not it is possible to construct a
particular total using a specific number of coins. For example, it is possible
to have a total of $1.00 using four coins if they are all quaters. However,
there is no way to have a total of $1.00 using 5 coins. Yet it is possible to
have $1.00 using 6 coins by using 3 quaters, 2 dime and a nickel. Similarly, a
total of $1.25 can be formef using 5 coins of 8 coins, but a total of $1.25
can not be formed using 4, 6 or 7 coins.
Your program should read both the dollar amount and the number of coins from
the user. It should display a clear message indicating whether or not the
entered dollar amount can be formed using the number of coins indicated.
Assume the existence of quaters, dimes, nickels and pennies when completing
this problem. Your solution must use recursion. It can not contain any loops.
