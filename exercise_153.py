"""
The novel "Gadsby" is over 50,000 words in length. While 50,000 words isn't
normally remarkable for a novel, it is in this case because nono of the words
in the book use the letter "e". This particularly noteworthy when one
considers that "e" is the most common letter in English.
    Write a program that reads a list of words from a file and determines what
proportion of the words use each letter of the alphabet. Display the result
for all 26 letter. Include an additional message identifying the letter that
is used in the smallest proportion of the words. Your program should ignore
any punctuation marks and is should treat uppercase and lowercase letters as
equivalent.
