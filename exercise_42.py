# Exercise 42: Frequency to Note.

"""
In the previous question you converted from note to frequency. In this
question you will write a program that reverses that process. Begin by reading
a frequency from the user. if the frequency is within one Hertz of a value
listed in the table in the previous question then report the name of the note.
Otherwise report that the frequency does not correspond to a known note. In
this exercise you only need to consider the notes listed in the table. There
is no need to consider notes from other octaves.
