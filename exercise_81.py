# Exercise 81: Compute the Hypotenuse.

"""
Write a function that takes the lenghts of the two shorter sides of a right
triangle as its parameters. Return the hypotenuse of the triangle, computed
using Pythagorean theorem, as the function's result. Include a main program
that reads the lenghts of the shorter sides of a right triangle from the user,
uses your function to compute the lenght of the hypotenuse, and displays the
result.
