# Exercise 48: Chinese Zodiac.

"""
The Chine zodiac assigns animals to years in a 12 year cycle. One 12 year
cycle is shown in the table below. the pattern repeats from there, with 2012
being another year of the dragon, and 1999 being another year of the hare.

Year    |Animal
2000    |Dragon
2001    |Snake
2002    |Horse
2003    |Sheep
2004    |Monkey
2005    |Rooster
2006    |Dog
2007    |Pig
2008    |Rat
2009    |Ox
2010    |Tiger
2011    |Hare

Write a program that reads a year from the user and display the animal
associated with that year. Your program should work correctly for any year
greater than or equal to zero, not just the ones listed on the table.
