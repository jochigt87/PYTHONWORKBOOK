# Exercise 113:Formatting a List.

"""
When writing out a list of items in English, one normally separates the items
with commas. In addition, the word "and" is normally included before the last
item, unless the list only contains one item. Consider the following four
lists:
    apples
    apples and oranges
    apples, oranges and bananas
    apples, oranges, bananas and lemons

Write a function that takes a list of string as its only parameter. Your
function should return a st' that contains all of the items in the list
formatted in the manner described previously as its only result. While the
examples shown previously only include list containing four elements or less,
your function should behave correctly for lists of any length. Include a main
program that reads several items from the user, formats them by calling you
function, and then displays the result returned by the function.
