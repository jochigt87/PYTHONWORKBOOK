# Exercise 46: Season from Month and Day.

"""
The year is divide into four seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter. While
the exact dates that the seasons change vary a little bit from year to year
because of the way that the calendar is constructed, we will use the following
dates for this exercise:

-----------------------------
Season      |First Day
-----------------------------
Spring      |March 20
Summer      |June 21
Fall        |September 22
Winter      |December 21

Create a program that reads a month and day from the user. The user will enter
the name of the month as a string, followed by the day within the month as an
integer. Then your program should display the season associated with the date
that was entered.
