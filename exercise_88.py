# Exercise 88:Is it a Valid Triangle.

"""
If you have 3 straws, possibly of differing lengths, it may or may not be
possible to lay them down so that they form a triangle when their ends are
touching. For example, if all of the straws have a length of 6 inches. Then
one can easily construct an equilateral triangle using them. However, if one
straw is 6 inches. long, while the other two are each only 2 inches. long,
then a triangle cannot be formed. In general, if any one length is greater
than or equal to the sum of the other two then the lengths cannot be used to
form a triangle. Otherwise they can form a triangle.
    Write a function that determines whether of not three lenghts can form a
triangle. The function will take 3 parameters and return a Boolean result. In
addition, write a program that reads 3 lenghts from the user and demonstrates
the behaviour of this function.
