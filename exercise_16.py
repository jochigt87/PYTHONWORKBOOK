# Exercise 16: Area and Volume.

"""
Write a program that begins by reading a radius, r, from the user. The program
will continue by computing and displaying the area of a circle with radius r
and the volume of a sphere with radius r. Use the pi constant in the math
module in your calculations.

    ðŸ‘‰ Hint: The area of a circle is computed using the formula area = pi*r^2,
    The volume of sphere is computed using the formula volume 4/3*pi*r^3.
