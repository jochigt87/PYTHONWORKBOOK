# Exercise 124:Evaluate Postfix.

"""
Evaluating a postfix expression is easier than evaluating a infix expression
because it does not contain any brackets and there are no operator precedence
rules to consider. A postfix expression can be evaluated using the following
algorithm:

    Create a new empty list, values

    For each token in the postfix expression
        If the token is a number then
            Convert it to an integerr and add it to the end of values
        Else
            Remove an item from the end of values and call it right
            Remove an item from the end of values and call it left
            Apply the operator to left and right
            Append the result to the end of values

        Return the first item in values as the value of the expression

    Write a program that read a mathematical expression in infix form from the
user, evaluates it, and displays its value. Uses your solutions to Exercises
122 and 123 along with the algorithm shown above to solve this problem.
