# Exercise 14: Height Units.

"""
Many people think about their height in feet and inches, even in some
countries that primarrily use the metric system. Write a program that reads a
number of feet from the user, followed by a number of inches. Once these
values are read, your program should compute and display the equivalent number
of centimeters.

    ðŸ‘‰ Hint: One foot is 12 inches. One inch is 2.54 centimeters.
