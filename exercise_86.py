# Exercise 86:The Twelve Days of Christmas.

"""
The Twelve Days of Christmas is a repetitive song that describes an
increasingly long list of gifts sent to one's true love on each of 12 days. A
single gift is sent on the first day. A new gift is added to the collection on
each additional day, and then the complete collection is sent. The first three
verses of the song are shown below.
The complete lyrics are avaliable on the internet.

On the first day of Christmas
my true lo sent to me:
A partridge in a pear tree.


On the first day of Christmas
my true lo sent to me:
Two turtle doves,
and a partridge in a pear tree.
.

On the first day of Christmas
my true lo sent to me:
Three French hens,
Two turtle doves,
and a partridge in a pear tree.

Your task is to write a program that displays the complete lyrics for The
Twelve Days of Christmas. Write a function that takes the verse number as its
only parameter and display the specified verse of the song. Then call that
function 12 times with integers that increase from 1 to 12.
    Each item that is sent to the recipeint in the song should only appear
once in your program, with the possible exception of the partridge. It may
appear twice if that helps you handle the difference between "A partridge in a
pear tree" in the first verse and "And a partridge in a pear tree" in the
subsequent verses. improt your solution to Exercise 85 to help you complete
this exercise.
