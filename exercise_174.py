# Exercise 174:Run-Length Encoding.

"""
Write a recursive function that implemets the run-length compression technique
described in Exercise 173. Your function will take a list or a string as its
only parameter. It should return the run-length compressed list as its only
result. Include a main program that reads a string from the user, compresses
it, and display the run-length encoded result.

Hint: You may want to Include a loop inside the body of your recursive
function.
