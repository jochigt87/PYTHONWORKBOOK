# Recursion Exercises.

# Exercise 164:Total the Values.

"""
Write a program that reads values from the user until a blank line is entered.
Display the total of all of the values entered by the user (0.0 if the first
value entered is a blank line). Complete this task using recursion. Your
program may not use any loops.

Hint: The body of your recursive function will need to read one value from the
user, and then determine whether or not to make a recursive call. Your
function does not need to take any parameters, but it will need to return a
numeric result.
