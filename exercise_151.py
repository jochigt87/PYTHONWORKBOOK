# Exercise 151:Two Word Random Password.

"""
While generating a password by selecting random characters generally gives a
relatively secure password, it also generally gives a password that is
difficult to memorize. As an altenative, some systems contruct a password by
taking two English words and concatenating them. While this password ins't as
secure, it is much easier to memorize.
    Write a program that reads a file containing a list of words, randomly
selects two of them, and concatenates them to produce a new password. When
producing the password ensure that the total length is between 8 and 10
characters, and that each word used is at least three letter long. Capitalize
each word in the password so that the user can easily see where one word ends
and the next one begins. Display the password for the user.
