"""
An online retailer provides express Shipping for many of its items at a rate
of $10.95 for the first item, and $2.95 for each subsequent item. Write a
function that takes the number of items in the order as its only parameter.
Return the Shipping change for the order as the function's result. Include a
main program that reads the number of items purchased from the user and
display the shipping change.
