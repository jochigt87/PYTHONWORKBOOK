# Exercise 148:Sum a List of Numbers.

"""
Create a program that sums all of the numbers entered by the user while
ignoring any lines entered by the user that are not valid numbers. Your
program should display the current sum after each number is entered. It should
display an appropiate error message after any invalid input, and then continue
to sum any additional numbers entered by the user. Your program should exit
when the user enters a blank line. Ensure that your program works correctly
for both integers and floating point numbers.

Hint: This exercise requires you to use exceptions without using files.
