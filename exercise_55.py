"""
Electromagnetic radiation can be classified into one of 7 categories according
to its frequency, as shown in the table below:

    -------------------------------------------------------
    Name                |Frequency range (Hz)             |
    Radio waves         |Less than 3x10^9                 |
    Microwaves          |3x10^9 to less than 3x10^12      |
    Infrared light      |3x10^12 to less than 4.3x10^14   |
    Visible light       |4.3x10^14 to less than 7.5x10^14 |
    Ultraviolet light   |7.5x10^14 to less than 3x10^17   |
    X-rays              |3x10^17 to less than 3x10^19     |
    Gamma rays          |3x10^19 or more                  |
    ------------------------------------------------------|


Write a program that reads the frequency of the radiation from the user and
displays the appropriate name.
