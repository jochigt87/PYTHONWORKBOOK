# Exercise 101:Reduce a Fraction to Lowest Terms.

"""
Write a function that takes two positive integers that represent the numerator
and denominator of a fraction as its only two parameters. The body of the
function should reduce the fraction to lowest terms and then return both the
numerator and denominator of the reduced fraction as its result. For example,
if the parameters passed to the function are 6 and 63 then the function should
return 2 and 21. Include a main program that allows the user to enter a
numerator and denominator. Then your program should display the reduced
fraction.

Hint: In Exercise 75 you wrote a program for computing the greatest common
divisor of two positive integers. You may find that code useful when
completing this exercise.
