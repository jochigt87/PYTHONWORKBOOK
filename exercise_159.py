# Exercise 159:Repeat Words.

"""
Spelling mistakes are only one of many different kinds of errors that might
appear in written work. Another error that is common for some writers is
repeated word. For example, an author might inadvertenly duplicate a word, as
shown in the following sentence:

        At least one value must be entered
        entered in order to compute the average.

Some word processors will detect this error and identify it when a spelling or
grammar check is performed.

    In this exercise you will write a program that detects repeated work in a
text file. When a repeated word is found your program should display a message
that containts the line number and the repeated word. Ensure that your program
correctly handles the case where the same word appears at the end of one line
and the beggining of the following line, as shown in the previous example. The
name of the file to examine will be provided as the program's only command
line parameter, or if an error occurs while processing the file.
