# Exercise 147:Words that Occur Most.

"""
Write a program that displays the word (or words) that occur most frequently
in a file. Your program should begin by reading the name of the file from the
user. Them it should find the word(s) by splitting each line in the file at
each space. Finally, any leading or trailing punctuation marks should be
removed from each word. In addition, your program should ignore
capitalization. As a result, apple, apple!, Apple and ApPlE should all be
treated as the same word. You will probably find your solution to Exercise 111
helpful when completing this problem.
